# Sudoku-Solver
A Python-based Sudoku solver implementing CSP with backtracking and MRV heuristic to efficiently solve 9×9 puzzles.
# 🧩 Sudoku Solver using Backtracking and CSP

A Python-based Sudoku solver that uses **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** techniques with **backtracking** and the **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** heuristic to efficiently solve 9×9 Sudoku puzzles.

## 🚀 Features
- Solves standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzles
- Uses MRV heuristic for optimal variable selection
- Constraint checking for rows, columns, and sub-grids
- Domain reduction for faster solving

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Backtracking Algorithm
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

## ▶️ Run the Solver

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sudoku_solver.py
